gwhatever I'm teaching you how to REALLY use GIT!
you are terrible and distracting
did you know you're cute?
I'm hungry..... and texting in git seems a little complicated...... and I miss Jupiter!
Well...kind of, it only seems that way right now because you're not used to it
		but it is pretty cool that I could send you a message from anywhere and you
		could get it

but i'm hungry................~~~~~~ 
git is epic for storage!
