gwhatever I'm teaching you how to REALLY use GIT!
you are terrible and distracting
did you know you're cute?
I'm hungry..... and texting in git seems a little complicated...... and I miss Jupiter!
Well...kind of, it only seems that way right now because you're not used to it
		but it is pretty cool that I could send you a message from anywhere and you
		could get it

but i'm hungry................~~~~~~ 
git is epic for storage!
OH! did you notice the weird hashes for each commit? type git log

we are almost done, should have ended at 6:30 technically

OMG I AM SO FUCKING HUNGRY!
arghhhhhhh and the kids on the couch are like falling asleep lol

at least it's not a full lab, arguably you should be home sooner than expected
